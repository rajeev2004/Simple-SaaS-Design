# Skyclad UI Design System

A lightweight **React + CSS** UI component library built as part of my application for the **Frontend React Intern** role at **Skyclad Ventures**.  
This project demonstrates UI component architecture, animations, modern interaction patterns, and a clean aesthetic inspired by the Skyclad website.
